Change log :
v0.9.5 (09/May/2013)
- Fixed some bugs
- Modified : rocker & wheel gesture syntax XX & XX >> XX-XX (RB & LB >> RB-LB , RB & WU >> RB-WU...)
- Important modifications on 'gestures.ini'.
• The 'Global' section is now renamed in 'Default'.
This means that if a gesture is not set for the active application but is set in the 'Default' section,
the triggered command will be the command set in the 'Default' section.
If you don't want default gestures, simply delete the 'Default' section.
• A new section was added : 'Master'. This section has the priority over all others sections.

Here is a summary of priorities* for the sections : Master > Process:Title > Process:Class > Process > Default
For the gestures : Gesture@Area > Gesture
* :    > means 'has priority over'


v0.9.4 (05/May/2013)
- Added : Screen Area feature (thank you @mright!)
• By default, screen area is splitted in 3x3 (9 areas). @1 = Top-Left , @4 = Middle-Left , @5 = Middle , @9 = Bottom-Right
• eg: L@3 >> Left gesture done at the 3rd area (Top-Right) of the screen
- Added : Shake Gestures feature. eg L-R-L or R-L-R or L-R-L-R... >> HShake >>  horizontal shake gesture (thank you @tsenlaw!)
Modifiers, rocker, wheel, shake and area feature can be combined! eg : #HShake@4 >> Windows modifier + Horizontal Shake @ Area 4
